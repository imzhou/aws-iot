This will make the devices smarter as you can use internal smart features of phones and watches and control these devices. \r\n\r\n- First you needs to create a Device in **Amazon AWS IOT** and then download 3 files (`certificate, private and public key`), you can use `root-CA.crt` from this project as its the same. \r\n- Secondly, you need to compile and run the hardware code into your device of choice, here we have used MediaTek LinkIt one.\r\n- Thirdly, you need to create an API server which connects your endpoint devices with the AWS IOT.\r\n- Finally, you need to create the frontend Apps for you endpoint devices.\r\n\r\n![architecture](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5811/23273769223_df780f6cd4_b.jpg)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
